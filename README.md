# Basic-Functional-Prototype-Implementation
This Basic Functional Prototype serves as a compact inventory management system designed to help small businesses track and organize their stock. The software allows users to add items with details like name, quantity, price, and category, while providing sorting capabilities through an efficient quicksort algorithm. Built with JavaFX, the graphical interface offers intuitive controls for adding, viewing, saving, and loading inventory data, which is stored in an ArrayList and persisted to a file for future access. The implementation demonstrates key object-oriented principles, including generics and inheritance, with a base InventoryItem class extended by specialized categories like ElectronicsItem and GroceryItem. The system efficiently handles core inventory tasks while maintaining a structure that supports future expansion, such as adding new item types or advanced features like search functionality. By combining file I/O, GUI interaction, and optimized sorting, this prototype provides a functional foundation that balances usability with technical robustness.
